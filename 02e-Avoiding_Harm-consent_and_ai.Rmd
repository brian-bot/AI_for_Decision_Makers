# Consent and AI

Much of the world is developing data privacy regulations, as many individuals value their right to better control how others can collect and store data about them (@chaaya_privacy_2021).

While data collection concerns have been ramping up for years, AI systems present new challenges (@pearce_beware_2021).

- It is more difficult to determine who is accountable at times when separate parties may collect vs use data
- Data collected for one purpose is getting reused for other purposes
- Accidental data collection due to collection for a different purpose
- Consent to allow data collection is trickier as it is less clear that users understand the potential risks

Consent is especially a concern for health care research, where potential participants need to understand the potential risks of participation. Yet, the risks of data collection continue to evolve.
