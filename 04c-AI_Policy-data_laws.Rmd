# Data Laws That Apply to AI

While countries and jurisdictions are developing ans passing laws that specifically deal with AI, there are also existing laws around data that should be considered whenever working with AI. These broadly include regulations about both intellectual property and data privacy.

## Intellectual Property Rights

There are multiple concerns around generative AI and intellectual property rights. These include potential copyright violations in the training data, whether generative AI methods can be proprietary, and whether material created using generative AI can be copyrighted.

### Does the training data include copyrighted or trademarked text or images?

In order for generative AI models to work, they must be trained on vast amounts of data. This might include images, in the case of image generators like DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, and Midjourney. It might also include human writing and speech, in the case of LLMs like ChatGPT and Bard. Information about the training data sets for these tools is limited, but they likely include text and images scraped from the internet. There is concern that the text and images gathered for training data included copyrighted and trademarked books, articles, photographs, and artwork. In fact, the CEO of Midjourney confirmed that copyrighted images were included in the Midjourney training data without the consent of the artists, and there was no way for artists to opt out of having their work included. A group of authors have also recently sued OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, for copyright infringement because their published works were included in the GPT training data.

### Can AI-generated work be copyrighted?

Generative AI makes it easier than ever to create 
Additionally, some artists have sued AI companies like the company behind Stable Diffusion because the generative AI tools are creating images that are too similar to their existing, protected artwork.

### Are AI algorithms proprietary?


## Data Privacy

Data privacy is especially important to consider when working in fields like healthcare, biomedical research, and education, where personally identifiable data and personal health information is under special protections.
